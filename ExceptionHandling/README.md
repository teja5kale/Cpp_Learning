# Exception Handling in C++ - Class-Based Demonstration

# Problem Statement

# Title:
Demonstrating Exception Handling in C++

# Description:
In this problem, you will implement a class `ExceptionDemo` that demonstrates how to handle different types of exceptions in C++. The program will:
1. Take two integers from the user (numerator and denominator).
2. Perform division while checking for exceptions such as division by zero and invalid input.
3. Use `try-catch` blocks to handle standard and custom exceptions, providing meaningful error messages.

# Objectives:
- Learn how to handle division by zero using exception handling.
- Understand how to define and throw custom exceptions in C++.
- Practice using `try-catch` blocks to catch exceptions and provide informative error messages.

# Solution Hint:
- Use `std::stoi()` to convert string input to integers, and throw a custom exception if the input is not a valid integer.
- Handle `std::runtime_error` for division by zero.

# Learning:
By solving this problem, you will:
- Gain a deeper understanding of exception handling in C++.
- Learn how to create and throw custom exceptions.
- Understand how to use `try-catch` blocks to catch and handle exceptions gracefully.
