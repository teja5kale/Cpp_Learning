# Implementing a Copy Constructor

# Problem Statement

# Title:
Implementing a Copy Constructor

# Description:
The task is to implement a class `CopyDemo` to demonstrate the functionality of a copy constructor in C++. You will:
1. Create a class with an integer and a string member variable.
2. Implement a copy constructor that copies the values from one object to another.
3. Provide methods to display the values of the members.
4. Prompt the user for input and create a copy of the object using the copy constructor.

# Objectives:
- Understand the purpose and functionality of copy constructors in C++.
- Learn how to implement a copy constructor.
- Gain practical experience in working with class objects.

# Solution Hint:
- Use an initializer list in the copy constructor to copy member variables.
- Implement a display method to show the values of the object.

# Learning:
By solving this problem, you will:
- Gain insights into object-oriented programming concepts in C++.
- Understand how to properly implement a copy constructor for classes.
- Learn about the implications of copying objects.
