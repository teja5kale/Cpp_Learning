Problem Statement
Title: I/O and Loop Operations with Classes

Description:
Create a C++ program that accepts multiple integers from the user, stores them in a class, and performs various operations such as calculating the sum of all integers, counting positive, negative, and zero integers, and displaying the results. The class should handle user input, processing, and display, and should be defined in a header and source file. The main function will use this class to interact with the user.

Requirements:

The program should accept integers from the user until they enter a sentinel value ('q').
Store the integers in a class.
Use loops to perform operations such as:
Sum of all numbers.
Count of positive, negative, and zero numbers.
Display the original numbers, the results of the calculations, and the numbers in reverse order.
