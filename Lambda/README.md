# Lambda Expressions in C++

# Problem Statement

# Title:
Lambda Expressions in C++

# Description:
The task is to implement a class `LambdaDemo` that demonstrates the use of lambda expressions in C++. You will:
1. Create a collection of integers.
2. Use a lambda function to sort the integers in ascending order.
3. Use another lambda function to filter out even numbers from the collection.
4. Provide methods to display the original and processed collections.

# Objectives:
- Learn how to use lambda expressions in C++.
- Understand how lambdas can simplify code for sorting and filtering collections.
- Gain practical experience with standard library algorithms.

# Solution Hint:
- Use `std::sort` with a lambda for sorting.
- Use `std::remove_if` with a lambda for filtering.

# Learning:
By solving this problem, you will:
- Gain insights into how lambda expressions work in C++.
- Learn to apply lambdas with STL algorithms for concise and readable code.
- Understand the benefits of using functional programming concepts in C++.
