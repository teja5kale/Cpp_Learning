# Pointers and References in C++ - Advanced Usage

# Problem Statement

# Title:
Exploring Advanced Usage of Pointers and References in C++

# Description:
In this problem, you are tasked with exploring advanced usage of pointers and references in C++. The program demonstrates pointer-to-pointer, reference-to-pointer, and performs operations such as swapping integers and dynamically allocating memory for arrays using pointers. This exercise will test your understanding of memory manipulation, dynamic memory allocation, and error handling in C++.

# Objectives:
1. Swap two integers using both pointers and references, handling invalid inputs.
2. Dynamically allocate memory for an integer array, and perform operations like sum, product, and finding min/max using pointers.
3. Demonstrate the use of a pointer to a pointer.
4. Demonstrate the use of a reference to a pointer.

# Solution Hint
1. Pointers:
   - Handle invalid inputs such as `nullptr` when passing pointers to functions.
   - Use pointer arithmetic to perform operations on dynamically allocated arrays.

2. References:
   - Ensure that references modify variables directly without requiring explicit dereferencing.
   - Use references to manipulate pointers and demonstrate pointer reassignment.

3. Dynamic Memory:
   - Use `new` to allocate memory for an array and perform operations using pointer arithmetic.
   - Properly free memory using `delete[]` to avoid memory leaks.

# Learning
By solving this problem, you will:
- Gain hands-on experience with pointers and references in C++.
- Learn how to handle errors and invalid inputs when dealing with pointers.
- Understand pointer arithmetic and dynamic memory allocation in depth.
- Explore the concept of pointers to pointers and references to pointers.
