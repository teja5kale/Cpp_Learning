# Template Function for Sorting

# Problem Statement

# Title:
Template Function for Sorting

# Description:
The task is to implement a class `TemplateSort` that demonstrates the use of C++ templates. You will:
1. Create a template method to sort an array of any data type (e.g., integers, doubles, strings).
2. Prompt the user for the number of elements and the elements themselves.
3. Display the sorted array.

# Objectives:
- Understand how to use templates for generic programming in C++.
- Learn about the flexibility of templates for different data types.
- Gain practical experience in implementing sorting algorithms using templates.

# Solution Hint:
- Use `std::sort` for sorting.
- Use a vector to dynamically store elements.

# Learning:
By solving this problem, you will:
- Gain insights into template programming in C++.
- Understand how to write functions and classes that work with any data type.
- Learn about the advantages of generic programming.
