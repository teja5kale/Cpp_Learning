# Smart Pointers in C++

# Problem Statement

# Title:
Smart Pointers in C++

# Description:
The task is to implement a class `SmartPointerDemo` to demonstrate the functionality of smart pointers in C++. You will:
1. Use `std::unique_ptr` to manage a dynamically allocated integer.
2. Use `std::shared_ptr` to manage a collection of integers.
3. Implement methods to display the value managed by `unique_ptr` and the values in the `shared_ptr` collection.
4. Include functionality to demonstrate the ownership and lifetime management provided by smart pointers.

# Objectives:
- Understand how smart pointers manage dynamic memory.
- Learn the differences between `unique_ptr` and `shared_ptr`.
- Gain practical experience in using smart pointers in C++.

# Solution Hint:
- Use `std::make_unique` for `unique_ptr` initialization.
- Use `std::make_shared` for `shared_ptr` initialization.

# Learning:
By solving this problem, you will:
- Gain insights into memory management with smart pointers in C++.
- Learn how to prevent memory leaks and dangling pointers.
- Understand ownership semantics provided by smart pointers.
