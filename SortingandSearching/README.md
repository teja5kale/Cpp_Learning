Problem Statement
Title: Sorting and Searching in a Dynamic Array

Description:
Create a C++ program that uses dynamic arrays to accept a series of integers from the user, sorts them, and performs various searching algorithms (like linear search and binary search). The program should implement classes to handle input, sorting, searching, and displaying results. The class definitions should be placed in header files, and the implementation should be in separate source files. The main function will use these classes to interact with the user.

Requirements:

Accept a series of integers from the user until a sentinel value (e.g., 'q') is entered.
Store these integers in a dynamic array (using vectors).
Sort the integers using a sorting algorithm (e.g., quicksort or bubble sort).
Implement searching algorithms:
Linear search.
Binary search (only applicable if the array is sorted).
Display the original and sorted arrays, as well as the results of the searches.
