Title: Understanding Constants in C++

Design a C++ class that demonstrates the use of constants in class methods, constant data members, and constant pointers. Your program should:

Define a class ConstantDemo that has a constant member variable and a non-constant member.
Implement constant and non-constant member functions.
Demonstrate the behavior of constant objects, constant member functions, and constant pointers to objects.
