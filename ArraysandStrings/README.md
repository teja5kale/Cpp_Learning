1. Problem Statement
Title: Arrays and Strings Operations with Classes

Description:
Create a C++ program that accepts multiple strings from the user, stores them in a class, and performs various operations such as sorting the strings, concatenating them, and displaying the results. The class should handle user input, processing, and display, and should be defined in a header and source file. The main function will use this class to interact with the user.

Requirements:

The program should accept strings from the user until they enter a sentinel value ('q').
Store the strings in a class.
Use arrays and strings to perform operations such as:
Sorting the strings.
Concatenating all strings.
Display the original strings and the results of the operations.
