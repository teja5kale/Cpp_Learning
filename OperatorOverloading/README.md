# Operator Overloading in C++

# Problem Statement

# Title:
Operator Overloading in C++

# Description:
The task is to implement operator overloading in a class `Vector` that represents a 2D vector. You will:
1. Implement addition (`+`) and subtraction (`-`) operators to add and subtract two vectors.
2. Overload the output stream operator (`<<`) to display the vector components in a readable format.
3. Demonstrate the usage of the overloaded operators in the main function.

# Objectives:
- Learn how to overload operators in C++.
- Understand the benefits of operator overloading for custom data types.
- Practice using friend functions for operator overloading.

# Solution Hint:
- Overload the addition and subtraction operators as member functions.
- Use a friend function for the output stream operator to allow access to private members.

# Learning:
By solving this problem, you will:
- Gain practical experience with operator overloading in C++.
- Understand how to create user-friendly interfaces for custom classes.
- Learn the importance of encapsulation and the use of friend functions.
